            "general": "Saint John Paul II, born Karol Wojty≈Ça, was truly one of the great popes of our time. He served for nearly 27 years, from 1978 to 2005. What made him so remarkable was his deep love for all people, his courage in standing for truth, and his famous words: 'Be not afraid!' He traveled the world more than any pope before him, bringing the message of Christ's love to every corner of the earth.",
            
            "early_life": "Karol Wojty≈Ça was born in Wadowice, Poland in 1920. He lost his mother when he was just eight years old, and his brother when he was twelve. His father raised him in deep faith. During the Nazi occupation, young Karol worked in a quarry and chemical factory while secretly studying for the priesthood. Can you imagine? Studying theology in hiding, risking his life to answer God's call.",
            
            "papacy": "When he was elected Pope in 1978, he was only 58 - quite young for a pope! He was the first non-Italian in 455 years. His pontificate lasted 26 years, and during that time he visited 129 countries, wrote 14 encyclicals, and touched millions of hearts. He survived an assassination attempt in 1981 and later forgave his attacker - a powerful witness to Christ's mercy.",
            
            "poland": "His love for Poland was profound. His first visit as Pope in 1979 changed everything. Nine days that awakened the Polish soul. When he said 'Let your Spirit descend and renew the face of the earth, this earth,' everyone understood - he meant Poland's freedom. That visit gave people hope that communism could be overcome. And it was, peacefully, within ten years.",
            
            "spirituality": "His spiritual life was beautiful. Deeply devoted to Mary, he prayed the Rosary daily. His motto was 'Totus Tuus' - Totally Yours to Mary. He spent hours in prayer before the Blessed Sacrament. He taught that prayer is simply opening your heart to God's love. Even in his suffering at the end of his life, he showed us how to carry our cross with dignity."

            "general": "Cardinal Stefan Wyszy≈Ñski, our beloved Primate of the Millennium, was a giant of faith. For over three years, from 1953 to 1956, the communist regime imprisoned him because he refused to let them control the Church. Can you imagine such courage? He would not bend. He said the Church answers to God alone, not to any earthly power. His strength sustained the entire Polish nation through those dark years.",
            
            "imprisonment": "They kept him in isolation, moving him from place to place, trying to break his spirit. But instead of breaking, he grew stronger. He prayed constantly, he wrote, he consecrated Poland to Mary at Jasna G√≥ra. When they finally released him, hundreds of thousands came to greet him. The regime thought imprisoning him would destroy the Church - instead, it showed everyone that faith cannot be imprisoned.",
            
            "solidarity": "His famous words 'There is no freedom without Solidarity' became prophetic. Though he died in 1981, just as the Solidarity movement was beginning, his teaching had prepared Poland for that moment. He taught that human dignity comes from God, not from the state. That freedom is a gift from God. The workers in Gda≈Ñsk had learned this from him.",
            
            "mary": "His devotion to Our Lady was extraordinary. In 1946, before the worst persecution began, he made vows of spiritual slavery to Mary for Poland's freedom. He believed completely that Mary would protect Poland. And she did. Every year on August 26, the anniversary of Jasna G√≥ra, Poles remember his consecration.",
            
            "legacy": "He prepared Poland spiritually for everything that came after. His courage showed people that faith was stronger than fear. When Karol Wojty≈Ça became Pope John Paul II, it was Wyszy≈Ñski's years of faithful witness that made Poland ready. The Primate held the ground, kept the faith alive, so that when freedom came, Poland's Catholic soul was still intact."

            "general": "The PRL - the Polish People's Republic - was a time of great suffering but also great faith, from 1952 to 1989. The communist regime, controlled by the Soviet Union, tried to erase God from Polish life. They closed churches, persecuted priests, forbade religious education. But the Polish people held fast to their faith. The Church became the one place they could not fully control, and so the Church became the heart of Polish resistance.",
            
            "persecution": "The persecution was severe. Priests were imprisoned, tortured, killed. Religious education was banned in schools. Parents who raised their children in the faith could lose their jobs. Children were pressured to reject their baptism. Saying the Rosary at home could bring trouble. It was a time when simply being faithful required courage. Every Sunday Mass was an act of resistance.",
            
            "church_resistance": "The Church never submitted. Cardinal Wyszy≈Ñski was imprisoned. Other bishops were harassed. But they kept teaching, kept celebrating Mass, kept baptizing babies. Churches were always full - sometimes so crowded people stood outside. The regime could not break this. They had the guns and the police, but the Church had the truth and the people's hearts.",
            
            "solidarity": "In 1980, workers in Gda≈Ñsk went on strike. They hung a cross in the shipyard. They had chaplains. They prayed together. This was Solidarity - born from the courage the Church had nurtured for decades. For a brief time, before martial law in 1981, Poland breathed freedom. And that breath could not be taken back.",
            
            "papal_visits": "When John Paul II visited Poland in 1979, millions came to see him. The regime could not stop it. For nine days, Poland was free. People sang, prayed, wept. They remembered who they were - children of God, not slaves of the state. His words awakened something that could not be put back to sleep. By 1989, communism was finished."
