---

## Quick Deploy (2 minutes)

### Option 1: Deploy via GitHub (Recommended)

```bash
cd "/Users/muhammad/Personal/Projects/Personal Projects/Voxie/voxie"

# Commit and push all changes
git add .
git commit -m "Add Exercise 4 backend deployment - Ready for Railway"
git push origin main
```

Then:
1. Go to https://railway.app
2. Click on your existing "voxie-1" project
3. Click "New" ‚Üí "GitHub Repo"
4. Select your repository and the `main` branch
5. Railway will auto-detect and deploy!

### Option 2: Deploy via Railway CLI

```bash
cd "/Users/muhammad/Personal/Projects/Personal Projects/Voxie/voxie"

# Install Railway CLI if needed
brew install railway  # or: npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login and deploy
railway login
railway link  # Link to your existing voxie-1 project
railway up
```

---

## Environment Variables to Set

After deployment, go to Railway dashboard ‚Üí your project ‚Üí Variables tab and add:

```bash
# Required
```bash
LIVEKIT_URL=
LIVEKIT_API_KEY=
LIVEKIT_API_SECRET=
SUPABASE_URL=
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
OPENAI_API_KEY=
```

# Optional
```bash
RAGIE_API_KEY=
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=
DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=
ENABLE_BACKEND_LOGGING=
```

## Test After Deployment (1 minute)

### Test 1: Health Check
```bash
curl https://voxie-1.railway.app/
```

**Expected:**
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "service": "voxie-backend",
  "timestamp": "2025-..."
}
```

### Test 2: Agents API
```bash
curl https://voxie-1.railway.app/api/agents
```

**Expected:**
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "count": 3,
  "agents": [...]
}
```

### Or run the test script:
```bash
cd "/Users/muhammad/Personal/Projects/Personal Projects/Voxie/voxie"
./test_deployment.sh
```

---

## Test with Frontend

```bash
cd "/Users/muhammad/Personal/Projects/Personal Projects/Voxie/voxie"
open simple_call_interface_cloud.html
```

The backend URL is already pre-filled: `https://voxie-1.railway.app`

1. Click "Load Agents" - Should load your agents from Supabase
2. Select an agent
3. Click "Start Call"
4. Speak with your cloud-deployed agent!

## What Happens When You Deploy

1. **Railway builds your project:**
   - Detects Python project
   - Installs dependencies from `requirements.txt`
   - Uses `Procfile` to determine start command

2. **Backend starts:**
   - Loads environment variables
   - Connects to Supabase
   - Starts FastAPI server on Railway's assigned port
   - Exposes API at `https://voxie-1.railway.app`

3. **You can test immediately:**
   - Health endpoint works
   - Agents API returns data from Supabase
   - Frontend can connect and create calls

4. **Voice calls work:**
   - Frontend ‚Üí Railway Backend ‚Üí LiveKit
   - Cloud agent (Exercise 3) joins automatically
   - Full voice conversation via WebRTC
